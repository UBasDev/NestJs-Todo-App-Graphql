<strong>This is classic To-do API and built by UCB :) GraphQl api built with NestJs and its tools, code-first is my always choice. Accesstokens and RefreshTokens are built with JWT. Additionally user roles are binded into JWT claims so we can specify 'Admin', 'SuperUser' and 'User' restrictions for queries and mutations. We can check Handler level and Class level roles both. PassportJs has been used for powering JWT. Also they are powered by my custom strategies, custom decorators and custom guards. Argon2 has been used to hash the data for database. And Prisma has been used for mapping the entities. There are strict CRUD restrictions(for example you cant even update a TODO or MEETING if it doesnt belong you!).</strong>
